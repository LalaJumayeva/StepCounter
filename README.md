# Step Counter App

This is a Step Counter app built using React Native and TypeScript. It displays a ring progress component and allows the user to select different dates to view their step count progress.

## Features

- Horizontally scrollable list of date options.
- Ring progress component to visualize step count progress.
- Dynamic updating of step count, distance, and flights climbed values based on the selected date option.
- Support for random values when progress is not zero.
- Ability to reset values to zero by clicking on the progress rate text.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the following command to install the project dependencies.

5. Start the development server.

## Usage

1. Open the Step Counter app on your device or emulator.
2. Scroll horizontally to view different date options.
3. Click on a date option to select it and view the step count progress.
4. If the progress rate is not zero, the step count, distance, and flights climbed values will update randomly because I haven't used API to count your steps so I just used random numbers.
5. To reset the values to zero, click on the progress rate text.
